# FullStackOpen-ReactNative
Separate repo for the final section of Full Stack Open 2020, which is all about React Native. The main repository for the rest of my Full Stack Open submissions can be found [here](https://github.com/TynanByrne/FullStackOpen-ReactNative).

## What was taught?

This section focuses on React Native development for Android and iOS, using Expo to get everything working. I personally tested the application being built with my Android smartphone.

Drawing on previous React and GraphQL knowledge, the course highlights the differences (and similarities!) between React and React Native, and shows how a mobile application can be put together. The focus here is on the front end and communicating with a pre-built GraphQL server.

Interesting points include:
* Using Formik and yup for great form management and validation
* Using flexbox to create the layout
* Basic testing with jest-expo
* Infinite scrolling
* Storing data with async-storage
